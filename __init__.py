MyFamework provides modules that can be helpful in various projects by providing generally valid modules and recurring functions.

# [Informations](./MyFramework/Informations.html)
The idea of this module follows two scenarios. Notes like infos, warnings, errors and debugging infos that are to be recorded during the execution of an application are ...
- ... are stored centrally in an object and made available for subsequent calls. This information can be displayed, stored or analyzed according to further use cases.
- ... output directly in the terminal using standardized and easily accessible functions.

Meta information such as file name, function and line number is automatically recorded.

And yes, you can also use break points during development. Output from MyFramework often gives a bigger picture and can also be used after development.

# [Data](./MyFramework/Data.html)
Functions in this module are used to display, analyze and manipulate data structures.
It can be understood as a collection of recurring manipulations and analyzations that help me while diving into a new topic or typing the same functions over and over again.
